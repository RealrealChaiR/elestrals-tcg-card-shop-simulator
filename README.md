# Elestrals TCG Card Shop Simulator Mod

Replace the Tetramon with Elestrals!

# How to Install

The Elestrals Mod is basically a texture pack applied using BepInEx and TextureReplacer.

Once BepInEx and TextureReplacer are properly installed:

- Drag and drop the `BepInEx/` folder into the same directory as the `Card Shop Simulator.exe`.
  - This can be found by right-clicking the game in Steam and go to "Manage > Browse local files".
- Restart TCG Card Shop Simulator.
